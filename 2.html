    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]=
    CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,includinglayout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improvecontentaccessibility, provide more flexibility and control in thespecification ofpresentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages toshare formattingby specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, andreducecomplexity and repetition in the structural content.
    Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present thesamemarkup page in different styles for different rendering methods, suchas onscreen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screenreader), and onBraille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules foralternate formatting ifthe content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]
